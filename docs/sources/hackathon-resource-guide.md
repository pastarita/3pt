THE HARNESS ENGINEERING &  
MODEL WRANGLING HACKATHON

RESOURCE GUIDE

HACKATHON DAY — SEPT 26   ·   The Malin Chelsea

MONGODB.LOCAL NYC — SEPT 30   ·   Pier 36  
PROBLEM STATEMENTS

This hackathon focuses on harness engineering: building the systems around a model (rules, context policies, guardrails, tool access and memory) that let agents adapt to a task, sustain work over long horizons and act on real data, including databases, documents, code and other business systems. Build against one of the two statements below, with MongoDB as your data and memory layer.

STATEMENT ONE: RECURSIVE HARNESSING

Build a self-improving agent harness that automatically evolves its own architecture: updating rules, context policies, guardrails, tool access, and more. How can agents dynamically adapt their entire environment to fit a specific user, task, or use case?

STATEMENT TWO: LONG HORIZON ENGINEERING

The highest-value agentic work spans hours, days, or weeks. Build a harness that sustains coherent memory across billions of tokens in one session, relentlessly optimizes toward long-term goals, and learns from hard metric signals to complete traditionally difficult tasks.

BUILD IN A DAY. SHOWCASE ON A GLOBAL STAGE.

MONGODB RESOURCES

RECOMMENDED STARTING POINT

Configure the following before you start building. Together, they give your AI coding assistant the context, connectivity, and prompting guidance it needs to work effectively with MongoDB. Build in the Atlas Hackathon Sandbox from your email; it’s required to be a finalist.

* [**MongoDB Agent Skills**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/agent-skills/) — A set of instructions that can be installed into an AI coding assistant (such as Claude, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot) to provide it with MongoDB best practices for connecting to a database, structuring data, writing queries, and implementing search.

* [**MongoDB MCP Server**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mcp-server/get-started/) — Enables an AI coding assistant to connect directly to a live MongoDB database to inspect data, run queries, retrieve counts, and manage Atlas resources.

* [**Natural Language to MongoDB Queries**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/natural-language-to-mongodb/) — Guidance on how to prompt an AI assistant effectively, including what details to provide about the desired task, data structure, and output format.

*Recommended sequence: install Agent Skills, connect the MCP Server, and reference the prompting guide throughout development.*

DEVELOPER TOOLS

* **Atlas Managed MCP Server** — A hosted MCP server that connects AI agents and automated workflows to Atlas using Atlas service accounts instead of end-user credentials. No local MCP infrastructure to run, and you can connect from any harness.

* **Frontier Marketplace Connectors** — Native Atlas access inside ChatGPT and Codex, Claude, Gemini, Grok Build, Devin, and Cursor. Query data, inspect schemas and manage indexes without leaving your AI tool.

DATA AND SEARCH

* [**Sample Movie Dataset**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix) — A ready-to-use dataset that can be loaded in minutes and is preconfigured for AI-powered search.

* [**Data Modeling in MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/#data-modeling) — Best practices for structuring data for efficient use by applications and AI agents.

* [**Vector Search**](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search) — Enables search based on semantic meaning rather than exact keyword matches, forming the basis for long-term, retrievable agent memory.

* [**Atlas Search**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/) — Provides fast, typo-tolerant keyword search capabilities.

* [**Automated Embeddings**](https://www.mongodb.com/company/blog/product-release-announcements/unlocking-ai-search-introducing-automated-embedding-in-mongodb-vector-search) — Generates and maintains vector embeddings within the database, removing the need for a separate embedding pipeline.

* [**Embedding and Reranking API**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-embedding-and-reranking-api/) — A single endpoint for embedding and reranking operations, accessible from any application or technology stack.

MEMORY AND AGENTS

* [**Building an Agent with Memory and Function Calling**](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/interactive-rag-mongodb-atlas-function-calling-api/) — An example of an agent that retains context and executes functions to act on data.

* [**Adding Memory to a Chat Application (Python)**](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/advanced-rag-langchain-mongodb/) — Demonstrates how to maintain context across a conversation using LangChain and MongoDB Atlas.

* [**Adding Memory to a Chat Application (JavaScript)**](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/add-memory-to-javascript-rag-application-mongodb-langchain/) — The same approach implemented in JavaScript.

STATE

* [**Build an AI Agent with LangGraph and MongoDB Atlas**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/ai-integrations/langgraph/build-agents/) — A practical example using thread-specific checkpoints and conversation persistence.
